# homepage.app

This is a web application that I'm going to use to replace iGoogle, which I really enjoyed using. It will have a Google search bar and show the local weather forecast, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, as well as a randomly selected image of Earth from the previous day, taken by NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera. 

When finished, the application will be fully optimized for both mobile devices and desktops. It will also comply with as many accessibility guidelines as I can find. 

The site uses AngularJS version 1.6.2, which interacts with an API done with Lumen by Laravel. For now, I am manually creating all stylesheets, rather than using Bootstrap. 

The site is currently hosted at [ckeele.com](ckeele.com).
