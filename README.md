This is a simple web application which will show the local weather forecast, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day, and a randomly selected image of Earth from the previous day, taken by NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera. 

When fully finished, the application will be fully optimized for both mobile devices and desktops. It will also comply with as many accessibility guidelines as I can find.
